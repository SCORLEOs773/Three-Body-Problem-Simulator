# Three-Body Problem Simulation

This repository contains Python implementations of the **Three-Body Problem**, a classical problem in celestial mechanics that involves predicting the motion of three bodies under mutual gravitational attraction. The simulations are available in both **2D** and **3D** versions.

## Features
- **2D Simulation**: Visualizes the orbits of three bodies in a 2D plane.
- **3D Simulation**: Adds depth and realism by simulating the bodies in three-dimensional space.
- **Custom Initial Conditions**: Modify mass, velocity, and starting positions for different scenarios.
- **Animated Trajectories**: Real-time visualization using `matplotlib.animation`.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/three-body-simulation.git
   cd three-body-simulation

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

3. Run the simulation:
      a. 2D Version:
      ```sh
      python three_body_2d.py
      ```
      b. 3D Version:
      ```sh
      python three_body_3d.py

## ðŸ“œ How It Works

### Equations of Motion
The system is governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation:
```sh
F=G 
r 
2
 
m 
1
â€‹
 m 
2
â€‹```
